- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adremasu
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m actually a former developer. Now I am a farmer.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in software that can simplify farm administration and also in farm automation, but I am not a great maker, as I don't have the maker skills
- ğŸ“« If you want to collaborate on any project just send me an e-mail at info [at] capolavia.it
